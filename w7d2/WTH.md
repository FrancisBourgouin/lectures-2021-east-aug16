# What was hard during weekend

- Hooks in general (R)
- State (R)
- State is updated -> managed by the component that owns it (R)
- Props++ (Kinda of a react thing)

- {...} Spreading (NR)
- Learning React without basics of JSX (NR)
- Errors (NR)
- Ways of styling + BEM ++ (NR)

## Spreading:

|B|
|B| -> toast

[1,2,3,4] => someArray
1,2,3,4 => ...someArray => for(const element of arr){element}
[...someArray]

{a:1} =>Â someObject
{...someObject}
